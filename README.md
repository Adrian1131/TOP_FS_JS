# TOP_FS_JS
This repository will include some projects, and the things I have learned and developed over the course of working through The Odin Projects Full Stack Javascript path 
they offer. I hope this can also help someone in need. This repository will be constantly updated, with files and projects being added. I am no expert by any means, criticism will 
be useful, or any other ways to approach better solutions. 

Thank you. Happy coding.
